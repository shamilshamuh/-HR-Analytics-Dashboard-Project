# -HR-Analytics-Dashboard-Project
An interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built with Power BI to visualize and analyze employee attrition, job satisfaction, and demographic trends for strategic HR decision-making.

# üéØ Project Objectives

To analyze employee attrition rates and identify key factors influencing turnover.
To explore demographic trends such as age, gender, and education to support HR planning.

# Problem Statement
Organizations often face challenges in understanding the root causes of employee attrition and satisfaction due to scattered or unstructured HR data. Without clear insights into workforce trends‚Äîsuch as which departments have the highest turnover or how demographic factors influence retention‚ÄîHR teams struggle to make informed decisions. This project addresses the need for a data-driven solution by building an interactive Power BI dashboard that uncovers key patterns in attrition, job satisfaction, and employee demographics, enabling smarter and more strategic HR actions.
